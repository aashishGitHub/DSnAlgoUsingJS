# Cursor Rules for DSA Problem Solving Patterns

## Documentation & Real-World Examples

### 1. Function Documentation
- Always include `@example` blocks in JSDoc comments with real-world scenarios
- Use practical, relatable examples (calendar meetings, time tracking, resource booking, etc.)
- Explain the business logic and interpretation of results
- Include time/space complexity in documentation

### 2. Test Cases
- Add descriptive test case names that explain the real-world scenario
- Include comments explaining the business context
- Use realistic data that relates to actual use cases
- Group test cases by functionality, not just by technical edge cases

### 3. Code Organization
- Categorize problems by pattern (e.g., MergeIntervals, SlidingWindow, TwoPointers)
- Place related problems in the same directory
- Use clear, descriptive file names that indicate the problem type
- Maintain consistent structure across similar problems

### 4. Mental Model & Revision
- Add comments that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Include visual examples or step-by-step explanations where helpful
- Document the pattern recognition approach (when to use this algorithm)
- Add practical use cases that help build mental models

### 5. Real-World Examples to Include
When documenting algorithms, consider these common real-world scenarios:
- **Calendar/Scheduling**: Meeting consolidation, availability checking
- **Time Tracking**: Work sessions, billing periods, service periods
- **Resource Management**: Room bookings, equipment reservations
- **Network/Systems**: Maintenance windows, downtime periods
- **Business Logic**: Subscription periods, service windows
- **Data Processing**: Collection periods, processing intervals

### 6. Code Style
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect the domain (e.g., `meetings`, `workSessions`, `bookings`)
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep examples simple but realistic
- Format test cases with clear structure and comments

### 7. File Structure
- Implementation files: Include comprehensive JSDoc with examples
- Test files: Include real-world scenario tests with descriptive names
- README files: Document the pattern, use cases, and examples
- Keep related utilities and helpers in the same directory

## Example Pattern

When adding a new algorithm:

1. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc with `@example` blocks showing real-world usage
2. **Tests**: Create test cases with names like "Real-world: [Scenario] - [Action]"
3. **Comments**: Explain the business logic and interpretation
4. **Organization**: Place in appropriate pattern directory
5. **Examples**: Use relatable scenarios (scheduling, tracking, booking, etc.)

This approach makes code easier to understand, remember, and apply to real problems.
