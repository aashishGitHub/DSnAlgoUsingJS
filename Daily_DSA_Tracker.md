## 🚨 **When You're Stuck**

### **5-Minute Rule:**
If you can't identify the pattern in 5 minutes:
1. Look at problem tags (but not solution)
2. Think about similar problems you've solved
3. Consider brute force approach first

### **15-Minute Rule:**
If you can't make progress in 15 minutes:
1. Read the first hint or approach outline
2. Try to implement based on hint
3. Don't look at full solution yet

### **30-Minute Rule:**
If still stuck after 30 minutes:
1. Study the complete solution
2. Understand every line
3. Code it from memory tomorrow
4. Mark for weekly review
