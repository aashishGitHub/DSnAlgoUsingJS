# 🚀 My DSA Journey Progress Tracker

*Started: January 2024*

## ✅ VERIFIED REPO STATUS — 2026-07-07 (supersedes the estimates below)

After the repo-wide pattern rework (brute-force→optimized writeups, tests,
recategorization), the MEASURED state is:

- **Test suite: 600+ tests, all passing** (`npm test`) — includes cross-checks
  where multiple approaches to the same problem must agree.
- **`tsc --noEmit`: clean** (was ~800 errors before the rework).
- **Fully reworked to the gold standard**: Two Pointers (12 problem files),
  Sliding Window (3 collections + Kadane flagship), HashMap (7 files, legacy
  .js consolidated). Pattern-level headers + verified tests everywhere else
  (BinarySearch, CyclicSort, FastSlowPointers, MergeIntervals, IslandsMatrix,
  TreeTraversal, DP).
- **Bugs found & fixed during the sweep**: 5 wrong test expectations, 1 real
  algorithm bug (circularArrayLoop), palindrome case-sensitivity mismatch,
  sumZero duplicate-pair bug, moveNegativesToEnd data loss, LCS exports that
  never existed, plus assorted broken legacy .js files (consolidated/fixed).
- The percentage/status tables BELOW are the original manual estimates, kept
  for history — trust the test suite over them.

## 📊 **Current Status (historical estimates)**

### **Overall Progress**: 15% Complete
- **Patterns Mastered**: 1/10 core patterns
- **Problems Solved**: 8+ problems
- **Test Coverage**: Excellent (following TDD approach)
